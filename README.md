Hello Everyone,

We had an industrial project task at our college for which we decided to create an AAA rated survival game. We named our project "Across The Line" as the player has to survive and reach a certain mark in order to advance to the next level.

This repository contains the website which I developed in order for players to download the game on their respective devices.

Its a very basic website which contains a download link of game and gives some basic information and preview of the game. The users can also connect with developers through the contact page.

Technologies Used:
Unreal Engine for game development
ReactJs for website development
